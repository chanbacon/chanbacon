## Hi there 👋

### 🏞️ My Background 
My background is in psychology (Bachelor's degree) and outdoor experiential learning, with 10+ years of experience as a facilitator, project lead and programme coordinator) 

### 🧭 The Coding Journey 
About 4 years ago, I moved into an analyst role evaluating programme impact. Out of pure curiosity, I began learning **Python** and was quickly impressed by how programming could solve problems and present solutions with clarity and power.

Since then, I've been devoting more of my time to developing my programming skills. I am currently a student in **Kood Jõhvi**, a fantastic community for sharpening software development skills.

### 👨‍💻 Open-Source Project 
Here is an open-source project that addresses a long-term headache for my former colleagues and myself regarding incident handling and analysis: 
https://github.com/chanbacon/incident-reporting.git

I've made a commitment to build more open-source projects to contribute back to the outdoor community, which has played a huge part in shaping who I am today. I have written the project description so that non-technical users could also understand and use it.
