## Hi there 👋

My background is in psychology (Bachelor's degree) and outdoor experiential learning (10+ years as facilitators, projecte leads, managers, etc.) About 4 years ago, I got into an analyst role to evaluate impact and enhance programme effectiveness from programme data. Out of pure curiosity, I learnt about python and various data analysis and visualisation tools. I was impressed by how programming could solve problems and present solutions with so much more clarity and power.

A couple of years ago, life brought me to Estonia. Where else better to learn coding? I began to take this journey seriously and have built my foundational skills step by step. I am currently a student in Kood Jõhvi and aim to better my software engineering skills learning new concepts whilst applying them to build projects that have real-world impacts. 

Here is an open-source project that address a big headache of my ex-colleagues and myself over the years both when I was the frontline facilitator and the coordinator overseeing operations regarding incident handling and analysis. 

I have promised myself to build more open-source projects to contribute back to outdoor community, which has over the years made me the person I am today. I have tried to write the project description in a way that non-technical users could also use and understand the project. 

And as always, feedback is the greatest present.
