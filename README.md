## Hi there 👋

### 🏞️ My Background 
My background is in psychology (Bachelor's degree) and outdoor experiential learning, with 10+ years of experience as a facilitator, project lead and programme coordinator.

### 🧭 The Coding Journey 
About 4 years ago, I moved into an analyst role evaluating programme impact. To enrich my toolkit, I began learning **Python** and was quickly impressed by how programming could solve problems with clarity and power. Since then, I've been developing my programming skills to become a software engineer. I am currently a student in **Kood Jõhvi**, a fantastic community for sharpening software development skills.
